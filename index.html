				<p>      Music is sound, composed in certain rhythms to express people’s feelings or to transfer certain feelings. Dance is physical movement also used to express joy or other intense feelings. It can be anything from ballet to break-dance. In my life music is much more important than dance. I prefer experiencing most things inside my mind. I don’t need psychical movement to experience joy. Sometimes I use music to escape from reality, there is nothing I love to do more than listen to certain types of music that relates to my feelings at that moment. When I am a little bit down, listening to music with messages I am familiar with, is in a certain way comforting for me. As a child, I started playing the guitar. Sometimes when I feel creative I get my guitar and start playing. It is very satisfactory for me to listen to music I make myself. It empties my mind and gives me some kind of satisfied feeling. When I am, for example, in a bar enjoying music, I don’t feel the urge to move my body. </p>

						<h3> brief about guitar </h3>
						<img src="img/guitar.jpg"  alt="pic of guitar" width="200" height="200">
						<p>A member of the family of musical instruments called chordophones, the guitar is a stringed instrument with which sound is produced by "plucking" a series of strings running along the instrument's body. While the strings are plucked with one hand, they are simultaneously fingered with the other hand against frets, which are metal strips located on the instrument's neck. </p>

						<h3> brief about flute </h3>
						<img src="img/flute.jpg" alt="pic of flute" width="200" height="200">
						<p> which the sound is produced by a stream of air directed against a sharp edge, upon which the air breaks up into eddies that alternate regularly above and below the edge, setting into vibration the air enclosed in the flute. In vertical, end-vibrated flutes—such as the Balkan kaval, the Arabic nāy, and panpipes—the player holds the pipe end to his mouth, directing his breath against the opposite edge. </p>
